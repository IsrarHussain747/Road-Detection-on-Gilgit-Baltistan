Roadside Detection using YOLOv8
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an object detection model to identify various roadside conditions, such as turns and obstacles, in images captured from roads in Gilgit. The project includes data collection, annotation, model training using the YOLOv8 framework, evaluation, and a comprehensive documentation process. This model could be valuable in applications like autonomous driving and roadside safety monitoring.

Project Objectives
Data Collection and Annotation: Collecting images of roads from the Gilgit area and annotating them to label different road conditions.
Model Development: Training a YOLOv8 object detection model for identifying specific road features.
Evaluation and Optimization: Assessing the model's performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall and optimizing for better detection rates.
Documentation: Preparing a report detailing data, model development, and results.
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the images collected and their corresponding annotations.
notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks, including model training and evaluation code.
models/: YOLOv8 model configurations and weights.
docs/: Documentation and reports.
README.md: Overview and instructions.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision
pip install ultralytics
Cloning the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/roadside-detection-yolov8.git
cd roadside-detection-yolov8
Usage
Data Preparation: Place collected and annotated images in the data/ folder.
Model Training: Run the Jupyter Notebook provided in notebooks/Roadside_Detection_using_YOLOV8.ipynb to train the model.
Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model on a test set to assess its performance. Evaluation metrics will be logged and visualized.
Deployment: Export the trained model to various formats (e.g., ONNX, TensorFlow Lite) for deployment.
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. Example results and metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are documented in the evaluation section.
